                    <h1>Giannis Sina Ugo Antetokounmpo</h1>
                    <p>
                        Giannis Sina Ugo Antetokounmpo is a Greek professional basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks
                        of the National Basketball Association. Antetokounmpo's nationality, in addition to his size,
                        speed and ball-handling skills have earned him the nickname "Greek Freak".
                        <br><br>
                        Born and raised in Athens to Nigerian immigrants, Antetokounmpo began playing basketball for
                        the youth teams of Filathlitikos in Athens. In 2011, he began playing for the club's senior
                        team before entering the 2013 NBA draft, where he was selected 15th overall by the Bucks. In
                        2016–17 he led the Bucks in all five major statistical categories and became the first player
                        in NBA history to finish a regular season in the top 20 in all five statistics of total points,
                        rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. He received the Most Improved Player award in 2017.
                        Antetokounmpo has received six All-Star selections, including being selected as an All-Star
                        captain in 2019 and 2020, as he led the Eastern Conference in voting in these two years.
                        <br><br>
                        One of basketball's most decorated players, Antetokounmpo won back-to-back NBA Most Valuable
                        Player Awards in 2019 and 2020, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and LeBron James as the only players
                        in NBA history to win two MVPs before turning 26. Along with his MVP award, he was also named the
                        NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2020, becoming only the third player after Michael Jordan (1988)
                        and Hakeem Olajuwon (1994) to win both awards in the same season. In 2021, Antetokounmpo led the Bucks
                        to their first NBA championship since 1971 and was named Finals MVP. The same year, he was selected on
                        the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.
