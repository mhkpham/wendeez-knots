					Giannis Sina Ugo Antetokounmpo is a Greek professional basketball 
					player for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association. 
					Antetokounmpo's nationality, in addition to his size, speed and 
					ball-handling skills have earned him the nickname "Greek Freak".
				<br><br>
					Born and raised in Athens to Nigerian immigrants, Antetokounmpo began 
					playing basketball for the youth teams of Filathlitikos in Athens. 
					In 2011, he began playing for the club's senior team before entering 
					the 2013 NBA draft, where he was selected 15th overall by the Bucks. 
					In 2016â€“17 he led the Bucks in all five major statistical categories 
					and became the first player in NBA history to finish a regular season 
					in the top 20 in all five statistics of total points, rebounds, 
					assists, steals, and blocks. He received the Most Improved Player 
					award in 2017. Antetokounmpo has received six All-Star selections, 
					including being selected as an All-Star captain in 2019 and 2020, 
					as he led the Eastern Conference in voting in these two years.
				<br><br>
					One of basketball's most decorated players, Antetokounmpo won 
					back-to-back NBA Most Valuable Player Awards in 2019 and 2020, 
					joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and LeBron James as the only players in 
					NBA history to win two MVPs before turning 26. Along with his MVP 
					award, he was also named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2020, 
					becoming only the third player after Michael Jordan (1988) and Hakeem 
					Olajuwon (1994) to win both awards in the same season. In 2021, Antetokounmpo 
					led the Bucks to their first NBA championship since 1971 and was 
					named Finals MVP. The same year, he was selected on the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.
